she's single because she's looking for 90s love
in this 2025 generation, people aren't dating anymore
they are just talking, catching feeling, sleeping together
and ending up in situationships

women reach a point in their life where it's not just about sex
it's about having a real man who loves her,
protects her and earns her trust.
if you really want her
you're gonna have to prove it with your actions, not your words

she wants effort, not excuses, consistency, not confusion
late night converstions, not late replies, loyalty, not lies
she's not asking for perfect, she's asking for real
she's done with half love and almost relationships

she wants something solid, something steady,
someone who won't ghost when things get real
someone who builds, not breaks
because she knows her worth now
and she won't settle for less than she deserves

if you really love that person, learn to wait.
sometimes...
love isn't about rushing or trying to make things happen right now,
it's about trusting that, if it's meant to be.
it'll happen in its own time.

Maybe today isn't the right moment for you both.
but that doesn't mean the future won't bring you together.
in the meantime, focus on being the best version of yourself.
on growing, and on building a life you're proud of.

love that's real, will find its way
and when the timing is right, everything will fall into place.
true love doesn't just fade away,
it grows even through the distance and the waiting.

so hold on, be patient and believe in what's meant to be.
let the universe work its magic and when the time is right,
you'll find yourselves together stronger and more prepared for a beautiful future

there are no accidents in who we meet
some people come into your life to challenge you,
some to remind you of who you are and inspire you, some to help you heal,
and some to show you the kind of love you never believed was possible,

we often think of encounters as random, a chance meeting,
a passing conversation or an appearance on your newsfeed,
but what if none of it is random? truth is, there are no coincidences,
every person shows up for a reason and a purpose,
even if you don't fully understand what that is until much later,

so pay attention to who walks in,
especially when you least expect it,
they may be carrying the wisdom, the wake-up call,
or the love your soul's been quietly asking for!

did you know that a single hug could change a woman's life?
science shows that hugs aren't just comforting,they're life changing,
but here's the catch: the magic lies in the length of the hug.

research suggests that a hug lasting a least 20 seconds releases oxytocin
the love hormone, which reduces stress, lowers blood pressure
and even strengthens the immune system
short hugs are nice, but longer ones they heal
they calm the heart, improve mood and deepen connections

and here's the most fascinating part
hugs can even lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol
helping your body fight off illness
and keep your mind at ease

don't miss your chance to make someone's day today
go give a hug that matters

I hope one day you realize
a woman who stays in a relationship waiting for you to change
is offering so much more than love.

that's devotion, true loyalty,
she saw only the good in you
and the potential you held.
not the hurtful things you said or did

so the next time you call her dramatic or crazy
remember, she didn't deserve any of that

can I tell you something?
you are the love that came without warning
and I can't stop thinking about you
it's like... all day and night you're the one that I am constantly thinking about

you're the first person I think of when I wake up
and the last person I think of when I sleep
I miss you every minute I'm not with you
you mean so much to me

so don't ever think I'm going away
not today, not tomorrow, not ever
