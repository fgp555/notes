psychology show that people with high emotional intelligence often feel more lonely
not because they lack connection, but because they carry too much awareness.
it's what's called the curse of knowledge, they don't just feel things, they see them
they sense changes in tone, a delayed reply,
or a glance that feels colder than usual, long after a conversation ends they replay

it not because they're insecure, but because they noticed what wasn't said
they predict outcomes before they happen
and when something goes wrong, they already know why and still feel responsible.
that's not overthinking, that's hypervigilance, a trauma response often rooted in childhood.

it forms in environments where emotions were unpredictable,
noticing tiny shifts wasn't optional, it was survival.
as adults they're always scanning, aways decoding, never fully relaxing

the loneliness doesn't come from being alone,
it comes from never feeling safe enough to just be,
and when your brain is wired to stay ahead of pain, even joy starts to feel dangerous,
if this sounds like you, you're not too much, you're just deeply tuned in and you deserve

I wanna marry a man who gets more excited about my birthday than I do
someone who plans little surprises just because he loves seeing my eyes light up
someone who remembers the stories behind the things I care about
and never treats my joy like an inconvenience

I wanna marry the man who asks how my day really was
and waits for the answer, the one who holds my hand in public
and holds my heart in private with the same gentle care
I wanna marry the man who knows love is not grand gestures only

the man who chooses me even when the world is not watching
the one who looks at growing old with me like it is something to look forward to
who believes love get better with time, not boring
who knows that forever is made just from moments like these

People run from good relationships
because they don't know what to do with real love
someone treats them right and it feels wrong,
too good, like a trick

so they go back to what they know
someone who ignores, them disappoints them
makes them work for basic respect
because that's what love looked like growing up
that's what feels normal

when someone actually shows up consistently,
actually cares, actually chooses them, they panic
they find reasons why it won't work
they create problems that don't exist
they push away the person who's good for them

then they end up with someone who treats them like they're not enough,
and it hurts, but at least it's familiar, at least they know this story

it's not that they want to be treated badly
they just don't believe they deserve anything better
so they choose what confirms what they already believe about themselves.

what if we try again? what if we give it a try?
and this time we'll finally make it right
I know deep in my heart I could let you go 100 times,
but my heart would never stop hoping you'd find your way back
to give us a second change to make things right
what if love is indeed sweeter the second time around?
what if we choose each other again?
but this time we fight harder to stay?
what if this time it could be better?

a good relationship is just two people saying:
Hey... life is hard but I want to do it with you,
that's it, It's not a highlight real,
It's not always romantic dinners or grand gestures
sometimes it's folding laundry together
and sending each other memes when words feel like too much
love isn't always loud
sometimes it's just choosing each other again and again
```
