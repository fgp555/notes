psychology show that people with high emotional intelligence often feel more lonely
not because they lack connection, but because they carry too much awareness.
it's what's called the curse of knowledge, they don't just feel things, they see them
they sense changes in tone, a delayed reply,
or a glance that feels colder than usual, long after a conversation ends they replay

it not because they're insecure, but because they noticed what wasn't said
they predict outcomes before they happen
and when something goes wrong, they already know why and still feel responsible.
that's not overthinking, that's hypervigilance, a trauma response often rooted in childhood.

it forms in environments where emotions were unpredictable,
noticing tiny shifts wasn't optional, it was survival.
as adults they're always scanning, aways decoding, never fully relaxing

the loneliness doesn't come from being alone,
it comes from never feeling safe enough to just be,
and when your brain is wired to stay ahead of pain, even joy starts to feel dangerous,
if this sounds like you, you're not too much, you're just deeply tuned in and you deserve

I wanna marry a man who gets more excited about my birthday than I do
someone who plans little surprises just because he loves seeing my eyes light up
someone who remembers the stories behind the things I care about
and never treats my joy like an inconvenience

I wanna marry the man who asks how my day really was
and waits for the answer, the one who holds my hand in public
and holds my heart in private with the same gentle care
I wanna marry the man who knows love is not grand gestures only

the man who chooses me even when the world is not watching
the one who looks at growing old with me like it is something to look forward to
who believes love get better with time, not boring
who knows that forever is made just from moments like these
