one of the hardest parts about being in a relationship is accepting that you
and your partner are going to hurt each other.
most people don't want to hear this; 
they think real love means never causing pain, but that's fantasy.
real relationships, that last require constant forgiveness
your partner will disappoint you
they'll say the wrong thing at the wrong time  
they'll let you down when you need them
not because they're bad people, but because they're human
and you'll hurt them too; you'll be selfish sometime.
you'll miss their needs 
you'll fail them in ways you never intended
the question isn't whether this will happen
it will the question is whether you're willing to work through it when it does
whether you can forgive and be forgiven
whether the relationship is worth the inevitable pain
perfect partners don't exist
but partners worth keeping do
they're the ones who stay and work through the hurt together

3 things a woman needs from her man, not 30, not 50, only 3 things

1. Attention: she needs to know that when she's talking you're not somewhere else and that her thoughts matter.
   put that phone down, make eye contact and listen; give her that focus and she'll feel value like nothing else

2. Respect: show her don't just say it, respect her choices,
   respect her voice, respect the woman she is; it's in your actions,
   not just the words. When she feels respect She'll stand by your side through anything.
   And that's when you now you've got something real.

3. Last one. Security: and I'm not just talking about finances man,
   make her feel safe with you, make her feel like she can trust you,
   when a woman feels secrure emotionally and physically,
   she'll bring out the best in you, and that's how a relationship grow strong

if you're gonna date me we have to agree to these 7 rules.

1. we will never go to bed mad or sleep on the couch
   because the reality is we don't even know if we wake up next morning
2. I want a least one date night per week because that's just good for each other's mental health
3. Let's not be susceptible, that pullutes a relationship and breaks good communication.
   So, let's just tell each other everything straight, even if it hurts
4. We are not allowed, to yell at each other, we can disagree but not yell,
   we could easily lose each other from each other's traumas and anger
5. If one of us is going through a harder phase
   or showing weakness the other has to step up and be the stronger one in the relationship
6. How about we always agree in public? we can disagree later in private,
   but not in front of others, bad people feed themselves off our differences, I don't want that
7. which is probably the most important for me that's always say I love you to each other
   and especially show it because I don't wanna become simple roommates

the minute you decide to get married you have to understand this one truth:
your partners is and should be the most important person in your life, yes, your parents are important,
your children are important but your partner is above all of them,
if something were to happen to you, you're not feeling well or you had a loss in the business,
who do you think is going to stand alongside you?
who is going to suffer along with you?
your partner right, there is a reason why your partner is called your better half

your parents have each other, if you have siblings,
they are also there to support your parents,
but your partner has only you,
so start to respect your partner and give them the priority that they deserve

if you just follow this one simple thing you will make your marital life so beautiful
and you will be able to balance all the relationships in your life
