if you're gonna marry me, we have to agree to these five rules:

1. we don't give up when it gets hard,
   marriage isn't a fairy tale; some days will test us
   but we made a vow, so we fight for us, not with each other.
2. we communicate even when it's uncomfortable.
   silence builds walls, honesty builds bridges,
   so let's talk even when it's messy.
3. we choose each other daily, not just when it's easy  
   but when we're tired, busy or not seeing eye to eye,
   love is a decision, not just a feeling
4. we don't keep score,
   marriage isn't 50 50s some days it's 80 20s
   some days it's carrying each other through the storm,
   we're not opponents, we're a team
5. we never stop dating each other
   even years in, even with kids, even when life gets heavy
   because the moment we stop trying, we start drifting
   so if you're going to marry me, know this
   I want forever, not convenience
   I wan't real, not perfect

the closer you get to someone,
the more clearly you see their flaws, that's reality
it's why marriages fail, why friendships fall apart
and why people walk away
you might think you love someone
until you see how they act when they're broke, stressed or desperate

but love is something else entirely
love isn't just a feeling, it's a choice, 
it's standing by someone even when their worst traits surface 
it's patience, kindness and sacrifice

love isn't easy, it hurts, it tests you
but real love means seeing the darkness in someone
and choosing not tu run
when you love someone, you learn things you never imagined
love opens your eyes to truth you wouldn't dare face otherwise

it's through love that even life's darkest moments
reveal threads of hope and resilience

5 psychology facts about best friends

1. if a friendship lasts longer than six years
   psychologists say it will last a lifetime
2. friendship is not about who you spend the most time with
   it's about who you have the best time with
3. a strong friendship doesn't need daily conversation
   it doesn't always need togetherness
   true friends can go days, weeks or even months without speaking
   and pick up exactly where they left off
   as if no time has passed at all
4. only a true friend will tell you to your face
   what others were saying behind your back
5. best friends are people who make your problems their problems
   just so you don't have to go through them alone

these are the six things that make a woman lose interest.

1. lying when you lie to her, it's not just about the truth it's about making her feel like a fool for trusting you
2. ignoring her: every time you ignore her you teach her how to live without you
3. going hours without texting: she doesn't need paragraphs just effort silence tells her she's she not even on your mind
4. being too busy for her: no one is that busy she sees the difference between someone who's busy and someone who doesn't care
5. making her feel like a second option
   she notices when your attention shifts and once she feels replaced she emotionally checks out
6. showing no effort: when she has to beg for love she stops craving it and starts healing from it
   her interest didn't die overnight
   you killed it piece by piece with your silence

they say a person only falls in love three times in their life
the first love usually comes at a young age
it's reckless, filled with passion but inexperienced
you grow apart and call it quits over foolish pride or petty things
years later you'll claim that wasn't real love
but for that version of you
it was everything love could be

the second love hits hard
this one teaches you lessons
and makes you stronger
you fall even harder than last time
and you get hurt and used because of it
it hardens, you teaches you to spot wolves in sheep's clothing
you emerge closed but wiser
knowing exactly what you'll never tolerance again

and then the third, this one doesn't knock
it slips in while you're not looking
every wall you put up gets demolished
you will find yourself caring about them without even trying
their flaws become sacred to you
you crave mornings with their chaos nights with their quiet
you want commitment and a family with them
this love feels less like falling
and more like coming home
to fire that's been waiting for you all along.

there are millions of pretty women out there,
loyal women, too fun and exciting women,
are in every city of every country on earth.

but if you have a woman who's helped you
when your mind was at war,
who didn't judge you or lose respect for you
as you struggled in the battle against yourself,
who cared who tried to help you in any way she can,
who was understanding, patient, loving and kind,

she's truly a one in a million
she's the one who sees the cracks in your soul and doesn't look away
she doesn't love you for what you can give her,
but for who you are, even when you don't recognize yourself.

and if you're lucky enough to have her you,
hold on to her with everything you've got,
because women like that aren't just partners,
they're healers, warriors,
the quiet force that pulls you back from the edge

soulmates don't meet by accident,
they meet because you both needed each other without knowing it.
because something in both of you was missing.
that only the other could bring

everything you don't have, they do.
and everything they don't have, you do.
soulmates don't come to give you every thing.
they come to remind you what it feels like to be whole.

they meet because something unexplainable wants them to.
because the world feels less like chace and more like purpose
when you find the person who makes it all feel right

I just need a hug not advice not solutions
not someone telling me to be strong
just a real quiet moment
where someone holds me

and I don't have to say anything
I want to feel like I'm not alone
like someone sees me
really sees me and still stays

I'm so tired of holding it all in
of pretending i'm fine
i just want to let go for a second
and feel safe

be like water, adapt and overcome
water doesn't fight obstacles, it flows around them.
when it meets a rock, it doesn't stop,
it find a way forward

over time, it even carves through the hardest stone
life will throw challenges your way
but instead of resisting learn to adapt
keep moving, keep evolving,
and let nothing stop your progress.

the person you love most is also the one who triggers you most.
that's not a coincidence, it's how love actually works
your partner isn't there just to make you happy
they're there to show you the parts of yourself you've been avoiding,

the wounds you haven't healed,
the patterns you keep repeating
the way they challenge you
the way they make you feel exposed and vulnerable.

that's not a problem with your relationship, that's love doing its job
real love doesn't just comfort you, it forces you to grow
it holds up a mirror to your worst habits and deepest fears
it makes you confront the version of yourself you'd rather ignore

that's why relationships are so hard
your're not just dealing with another person
you're dealing with everyhing they bring up in you that you thought you had handled
love isn't supposed to be easy, it's supposed to change you

I know I'm not perfect,
but I wanna be everything you dream of,
I wanna be the man who understands,
not just the big things,
but the small details too

I want you to tell me what you like
what makes you laugh
what makes you feel safe
teach me how to love you the way you want to be loved
I don't want to assume
I know what you need
I want to listen to learn
your happiness means everything to me
and I'll never stop stop trying to be the man who brings it to you

I wanna be the one who shows up for you who gets it right,
who learns from my mistakes
I'll always be ready to grow, to change
and to love you deeply than I did yesterday
tell me your dreams, your desires, your fears,
and I promise I'll be right here

one of the hardest parts about being in a relationship is accepting that you
and your partner are going to hurt each other.
most people don't want to hear this;
they think real love means never causing pain, but that's fantasy.
real relationships, that last require constant forgiveness
your partner will disappoint you
they'll say the wrong thing at the wrong time  
they'll let you down when you need them
not because they're bad people, but because they're human
and you'll hurt them too; you'll be selfish sometime.
you'll miss their needs
you'll fail them in ways you never intended
the question isn't whether this will happen
it will the question is whether you're willing to work through it when it does
whether you can forgive and be forgiven
whether the relationship is worth the inevitable pain
perfect partners don't exist
but partners worth keeping do
they're the ones who stay and work through the hurt together

3 things a woman needs from her man, not 30, not 50, only 3 things

1. Attention: she needs to know that when she's talking,
   you're not somewhere else and that her thoughts matter.
   put that phone down, make eye contact and listen;
   give her that focus and she'll feel value like nothing else

2. Respect: show her don't just say it, respect her choices,
   respect her voice, respect the woman she is;
   it's in your actions, not just the words.
   when she feels respect, she'll stand by your side through anything.
   and that's when you know you've got something real.

3. Last one. Security: and I'm not just talking about finances man,
   make her feel safe with you, make her feel like she can trust you,
   when a woman feels secure emotionally and physically,
   she'll bring out the best in you, and that's how a relationship grow strong

if you're gonna date me we have to agree to these 7 rules.

1. we will never go to bed mad or sleep on the couch
   because the reality is we don't even know if we wake up next morning
2. I want a least one date night per week because that's just good for each other's mental health
3. Let's not be susceptible, that pullutes a relationship and breaks good communication.
   So, let's just tell each other everything straight, even if it hurts
4. We are not allowed, to yell at each other, we can disagree but not yell,
   we could easily lose each other from each other's traumas and anger
5. If one of us is going through a harder phase
   or showing weakness the other has to step up and be the stronger one in the relationship
6. How about we always agree in public? we can disagree later in private,
   but not in front of others, bad people feed themselves off our differences, I don't want that
7. which is probably the most important for me that's always say I love you to each other
   and especially show it because I don't wanna become simple roommates

the minute you decide to get married you have to understand this one truth:
your partners is and should be the most important person in your life, yes, your parents are important,
your children are important but your partner is above all of them,
if something were to happen to you, you're not feeling well or you had a loss in the business,
who do you think is going to stand alongside you?
who is going to suffer along with you?
your partner right, there is a reason why your partner is called your better half

your parents have each other, if you have siblings,
they are also there to support your parents,
but your partner has only you,
so start to respect your partner and give them the priority that they deserve

if you just follow this one simple thing you will make your marital life so beautiful
and you will be able to balance all the relationships in your life
