Jordan Peterson Gives the Best Relationship Advice Youâ€™ll Ever Hear

https://youtu.be/lRuhRuuvnOE

I think that you should know someone well enough so that you know if you can negotiate with them
and so that you have started to formulate a vision of your joint future that you can both look forward to with enthusiasm
and confidence and of course that's going to depend to some degree on your level of maturity
but that means you've considered such things as do you have a suficient number of joint interests
and are you oriented in the same direction with regards to how you're going to handle your joint careers
and the possibility of children and that the manner in which you're going to interact with your in-laws
and you have to start considering your life together from the perspective of practicality and economics
I would say It can't just be that massive erotic attraction that's associated with love although I think that's extraordinarily important
and you're unbelievably fortunate if you have that and you should do everything you can to maintain it which and that takes effort and will

but, you need to ally that with maturity and intelligence
and the maturity and intelligence is ok, we're going to put our lives together.
what's that going to look like at the level of detail?
how are we going to handle our finance?
where are we going to live?
what are our joint plans going to be?
if you want to set up a household with someone,
then there's a lot of things that you need to get straight
and you either do that by bringing your unconscious assumptions to bear on the situation
and perphaps clashing where they don't match
or you sit down like a conscious, aware and articulate couple and start to negociate what your joint responsibilites are going to be so that would be, well who's responsible for the meals? and when?

what are you going to eat?
who's going to get groceries?
who's going to pay the bills?
who's going to do which part of what household chores there are do?
how is that going to be laid out fair?
so, you should get to know the person that you're with well enough.
so that you can start discussing the real practical issues of life
and determine whether or not you're capable of negotiating that
unless you've really made a commitment to someone like a lifetime commitment and that's a serious commitment one that you're not going to back out of you're not going to take the relationship with the seriousness that's necessary to make it of the highest possible quality and sustainability across the course of your life
and it's really important that it is of that high quality and sustainability
because the relationship especially when it starts to produce children is a machine, let's say a machive that you jointly operate that adds immensely to the quality of your life and the depth of your life

you have the rope and strand of your life and your partner has the strands
and the rope of his or her life and then those are tied together to make a stronger rope
and then that unites you across time and then you undertake massive adventures together
some of that is the establishment of a household the establishment of joint careers
and the maintenance of each other's mental and physical health,
the maintenance of a high quality sexual life and all of that very challenging to do all of that
and then the joint production and care children
which don't be thinking that you can't organize your life when you have children
the thing about modern people is that they're terrified of children
because they think they regard children as if they're miniature tyrants
they can be, of course because anyone will tyrannize over you if you allow them to perhaps not anyone but virtually anyone
why not regulate your children's behavior?
I wrote a chapter in my new book called
"Don't let you children do anything that makes you dislike them"
and that's like really serious advice it's like,
if you allow your children to conduct themselves around you in a manner that makes you dislike them
if you're paying attention to the shadow side of yourself that can be aggresive
and destructive then having children is going to mess up your life
but you don't have to do that you actually have a tremendous amount of control over the quality of your relationship with your children
and also the manner in which you choose to just disperse your time

WHEN LIFE BREAKS YOU - Powerful Motivational Speech

https://youtu.be/0cwtNOq_k4w

```md
I don't care how good you are, I don't care how talented you are
I don't care how much you work on yourself
there's some times when things aren't gonna go right.
there are times when anything that can happen, will happen.

Life happens. the unexpected. the uncalled for. the unintentional.
We've been damaged emotionally, damaged spiritually.
It may be your business, it may be your heart that is broken today
it may be the number in your bank account that is screaming you are broke.

you break physically, you can break mentally, you can break your heart,
you can break your spirit. and all of those are gonna leave a mark.
but the mark that they leave can be the mark of victory
or it can be the mark of defeat,
it is staying with the breaking that produces the blessing.
It is not what you go through that determines where you end up. it's who you listen to.

'Cause I think right now you are walking through a valley between two voices.
one is wisdom, one is worry, one is gratitude,
one is grumbling, one is blame, one is faith.

because every time you break, and in every way that you break,
while it's a chance for you to give up and for you to fall apart,
but there's also apportunity to get stronger. and get smarter,
and get faster and get tougher, and get more stable,
and get more resilient and get better.

What I need you to do is I need you to find a reason to keep going.
And if you can find a reason to keep going,
I know you're strong enough to do it, 'cause you're human.
and every human has what it takes to get past whatever they going through if they decide to.
push through it, push through it.
Tragedy and trials come to everybody, only the strong survive.
the fight isn't over. The fight is just beginning.
You have the opportunity to show the world what you are really made of.

I need you to look at that sickness that's going on in your life right now,
whatever it is, I want you to say:
I can beat it, I can be it, I will beat it, I must, I got a family to live for,
I ain't through yet, my life ain't over yet.
that's some things in life, you don't need no degree for it,
you don't need no money for it, you don't need no support for it,
there's some things in life you just gonna get though when you tell yourself:
I'm gonna get through this.

Regardless of what happens to you in life,
regardless of the adversity, regardless of the opposition,
regardless of the trial and tribulation,
nothing can stop you. the only thing that can stop you is you.
no situation, no circumstance, no piece of adversity can define your life,
never let a circumstance define you.

---

And I'm not retreating. I'm not running.
I don't care what they say on paper.
I don't care if you say we outnumbered.
We live by this and we die by this.
We don't retreat. We don't run,
we gonna stand, and we gonna live,
and we gonna die by what we stand for,
and everybody gonna know what we represent
and what we're apart of.
I got staying power, I got staying power.

Be encouraged today that no matter what you've walked though,
no matter how broken your marriege is,
no matter how many times you failed,
there is within you a spirit that is greater than whatever is going on around you.
If you would be willing to fight your way through this battle,
fight your way through cancer,
fight your way through that academic struggle,
fight your way through divorce,
fight your way through it,
if you are willing to fight your way through that singing carrer,
fight you way through boxing,
fight you way through football,
I'm telling you at the end of the fight is going to come victory.

and as you crawl up and out of that dismal and wretched place,
as you rise above what you were,
and as you take the form of who you are supposed to be,
you will see that in the very act standing up,
in the very act of fighting on,
you will become and you will remain unbroken.
