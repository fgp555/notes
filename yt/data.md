I think that you should know someone well enough so that you know if you can negotiate with them
and so that you have started to formulate a vision of your joint future that you can both look forward to with enthusiasm
and confidence and of course that's going to depend to some degree on your level of maturity
but that means you've considered such things as do you have a suficient number of joint interests
and are you oriented in the same direction with regards to how you're going to handle your joint careers
and the possibility of children and that the manner in which you're going to interact with your in-laws
and you have to start considering your life together from the perspective of practicality and economics
I would say It can't just be that massive erotic attraction that's associated with love although I think that's extraordinarily important
and you're unbelievably fortunate if you have that and you should do everything you can to maintain it which and that takes effort and will

but, you need to ally that with maturity and intelligence
and the maturity and intelligence is ok, we're going to put our lives together.
what's that going to look like at the level of detail?
how are we going to handle our finance?
where are we going to live?
what are our joint plans going to be?
if you want to set up a household with someone,
then there's a lot of things that you need to get straight
and you either do that by bringing your unconscious assumptions to bear on the situation
and perphaps clashing where they don't match
or you sit down like a conscious, aware and articulate couple and start to negociate what your joint responsibilites are going to be so that would be, well who's responsible for the meals? and when?

what are you going to eat?
who's going to get groceries?
who's going to pay the bills?
who's going to do which part of what household chores there are do?
how is that going to be laid out fair?
so, you should get to know the person that you're with well enough.
so that you can start discussing the real practical issues of life
and determine whether or not you're capable of negotiating that
unless you've really made a commitment to someone like a lifetime commitment and that's a serious commitment one that you're not going to back out of you're not going to take the relationship with the seriousness that's necessary to make it of the highest possible quality and sustainability across the course of your life
and it's really important that it is of that high quality and sustainability
because the relationship especially when it starts to produce children is a machine, let's say a machive that you jointly operate that adds immensely to the quality of your life and the depth of your life

WHEN LIFE BREAKS YOU - Powerful Motivational Speech

https://youtu.be/0cwtNOq_k4w

```md
I don't care how good you are, I don't care how talented you are
I don't care how much you work on yourself
there's some times when things aren't gonna go right.
there are times when anything that can happen, will happen.
Life happens. the unexpected. the uncalled for. the unintentional.
We've been damaged emotionally, damaged spiritually.
It may be your business, it may be your heart that is broken today
it may be the number in your bank account that is screaming you are broke.

you break physically, you can break mentally, you can break your heart, you can break your spirit. and all of those are gonna leave a mark.
but the mark that they leave can be the mark of victory
or it can be the mark of defeat, it is staying with the breaking that produces the blessing. It is not what you go through that determines where you end up. it's who you listen to.

'Cause I think right now you are walking through a valley between two voices. one is wisdom, one is worry, one is gratitude, one is grumbling, one is blame, one is faith.

because every time you break, and in every way that you break, while it's a chance for you to give up and for you to fall apart, but there's also apportunity to get stronger. and get smarter, and get faster and get tougher, and get more stable, and get more resilient and get better.
