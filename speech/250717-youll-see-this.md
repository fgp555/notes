we live in a world that tells us to go big or go home
the change must be loud
that impact must be massive and that if you are not shaking the world
well then you're wasting your time

but I believe that narrative misses something critical
in fact it skips the most powerful part of transformation
and if the light bulb hasn't gone off yet that powerful part I'm referring to is you
you are not a spectator to this life you're not here just to observe

---

you are the author the builder the one with the pen in you hand and a beautiful story to tell

and beyond that yes you also have the power to create massive change not just someday not just in theory but now today in this moment
here's my point though and the case that I want to make
I think most people approach it backwards they aim to change the world while skipping the only part of the world the actually have control over themselves

they rage against the machine but ignore their own gears grinding from neglect one of my favorite quotes as Tolstoy on said everyone thinks of changing the world. but no one thinks of changing himself

we want to change systems governments culture communities but we leave our own habitats untouched

we leave our own lives in chaos we try to fix people but we haven't yet learned to lead ourselves
and that leads me to a story a very simple story that I think brings this home right
there was a young boy walking along a beach shortly after a storm
the tide had gone out leaving thousands of starfish stranded on the sand drying in the sun

and one by one the boy began picking them up
throwing them back into the ocean
a man who saw it from the distance walked up and laughed
he said boy you're crazy there are thousands of those things you can't possibly make a difference

the boy picked up onother starfish threw it gently into the waves and said yeah well I made a difference to that one

see we overlook the truth every single day we underestimate the power of one gesture one disciplined morning one hard conversation instead of avoiding

because of its size and granularity we think it's nothing but in reality that little decision is everything
because greatness real greatness is completely detached from applause
it's built on alignment it's when who you are what you believe and what you do all match

now I say a lot of quotes are my favorite quotes but this is absolutely i think one of the best speeches ever given by admiral William Mcraven the university of texas and one of the premises to his speech he said if you wanna change the world start by making your bed
cause the simple act of doing something well something meaningful but small with discipline and pride begins a chain reaction it tells the world hey I respect myself I'm not careless with my time

I'm not a victim of the chaos I am a force within it that's what we forget change doesn't have to start with the world in fact it can't it can start with your morning it can start with your breath it can start with how you treat your spouse your kids your teammates your body your craft you don't need to carry the weight of the entire planet but I strongly advise you carry the weight of your intentions

see I've learned that broken people trying to fix the world often just project they spread more brokenness

but healed people they create ripples that outlive them
if you fix your routine you fix your energy if you fix your mindset you fix your response to setbacks
and if you fix your response to setbacks you become unstoppable this isn't about perfection it never was it's about presence it's about the courage to stop pointing fingers
and start pointing forward look maybe you're not where you want to be
maybe the mountain feels too steep
maybe you feel invisible in a world addictived to noise
but let me remind you something you can change your life you can redefine yourself
you can stop living on autopilot and start building a story that matters not to the masses but to you and to those close to you
your family your friends your community those who look up to you that is real power
so no pragmatically speaking you may not save all the starfish you may not reach everyone you may never get a standing ovation
but you can reach someone you certainly can be a light in one room
you can change the direction of your life and that's the only place change has ever started you are the stone dropped in still water
you are the start of the ripple so make your bed keep your promises say what you believe push through lead yourself
and when the world asks what difference that makes
you can smile just like that boy on the beach did pick up one more starfish
and say today here in this moment I made a difference to this one

```
so imagine you're sitting down having something to eat thinking, relaxing, reading, whatever you're doing
someone walks up to the table across from you pulls out the chair sits down kind of leans back puts one leg over the other casually tells you
you know you probably don't have what it takes to do anything significant in your life what would you say?
it would be outrageous, right? that's a ridiculous scenario
well let's say that the next day you get up you go to walk run workout and he shows up again starts running next to you casually reminding you that the odds of you changing doing anything for the better are slim to none that this is kind of a waste of time for you
you brush it off you go to work and guess who he passes by your desk leaves a little note saying you know that your bosses your higher ups they are cut from a different cloth they just see things in a way you can't
you'd probably tell that person to take a long walk off a short pier, right? or at the very least you'd understand how absolutely insane the situation is people cant just walk up and talk yo you like that

but now imagine that same person is you living rent free in your head and here's the catch you invited him in you allowed the negativity and the doubt to live there see every time I think about that self talk I can't help but wonder in a world of obstacles to navigate and challenges to tackle why is it acceptable for your biggest obstacle to be you
why should you allow or be okay with that and I'm not saying everything's perfect all the time every thoughts pure bliss but I am posing this question if you don't believe in yourself

how do you expect anyone else to? if you're not your biggets ally if you don't respect the person staring back at you in the mirror how do you expect the world to why is our inclination to tense up and refute that negativity from others but sit back and accept the same nonsense in our own heads if those words don't support what your're try to build
I don't care who they're from where they come from where they come from why they're there they don't deserve your time
and it's a simple awareness that they are not truth but merely your fears and your insecurities
