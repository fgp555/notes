```md
you can let the world break you
or you can let it build you
see I've learned something along the way that pain can become power fear can become fuel
and rejection if you're willing to look it in the eye
can become the spark that ignites a new beginning entirely

the caveat is that it only happens though if you stop seeing your setbacks as the end
and you start seeing them as the beginning of something bigger
there's an old story or anecdote that I guess in its beautiful simplicity has stuck with me right

in this story a farmer's donkey falls into deep dry well
and obviously it's stuck down there
and the donkey's crying and yelling
and hours pass and the farmer becomes aware
and he's doing everything he can to get his donkey out of the well
but it's just too deep and he's too far down there
and eventually with no way out you know the farmer has yo make an awful decision
the hardest decision he could make
and he begins to shovel dirt into the well thinking well I don't want him to suffer right so it's time to put the donkey to rest um but as he's doing this something strange happens right as the dirt falls down the well
and on the donkey's back uh the donkey doesn't lay down to die it shakes off the dirt
and each time kind of steps up a little bit shovel full after shovel full he continues to shake off the dirt and step up the very thing meant to bury the donkey became the platform it climbed until eventually the donkey walked right out of the well

you see I've been that donkey maybe you have too I've had people walk away when I needed them most
and that probably hurts more than anything else
I've heard you're not good enough more times than I can count sometimes from others sometimes from yup myself
I've stared down rejection letters empty rooms silent phones
I've spent months and months and months on projects that I thought would change the world
and news flash they didn't and for a while I belieced that metaphorical dirt I believed the labels the silence the fear
but somewhere along the way I stopped asking why me and started saying watch me
maybe that adversity is not the end maybe it's an opportunity to turn whispers of doubt into battle cries
to use the heartbreak as a blueprint for strength
