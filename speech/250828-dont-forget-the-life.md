```md
i wanted to know whether or not my heroes cried
odd question sure
but like how much separates us
are we merely in different leagues
or are we from different planets
do they ever feel down and if so
how do they appear so composed
what made them the chosen ones
did they ever feel less than ill equipped fearful
did they ever look around in a room and wonder
should i even be here
or were they gifted with a sense of complete and total acceptance

it's funny a big part of my collegiate experience was rowing
which means pretty frequently we would find ourselves doing sprint workouts on the rowing machine
