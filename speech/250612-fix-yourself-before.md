there are two kinds of crossroads first the external the crossroads that life beyond your control places before you
the abrupt changes the sudden twists the tragedies even the occurrences we don't quite understand and so chalk them up as fate

and then there are the internal the crossroads that you manufacture the ones that are self created self induced
the you know what I've had enough of this crossroads the I deserve better crossroads the there's more out there and today I'm going to find it crossroads

and I don't think the two are mutually exclusive in fact I think sometimes when we wait too long to manufacture our own crossroads life steps in and gives us a little nudge

the universe pushes us towards that change like a wind at our back doesn't quite make things black and white doesn't always put a catastrophe in front of us sometimes it's the mere whispering that hey

you're accepting more pain more friction than you should be it reminds us to take accountability to take control of life something that we seemingly forget more often that we should one of my favorite stories is Jim Rohn's fomous epiphany or light bulb moment the point where you know he basically realizes enough's enough right I'm creating a crossroads here and going down the road that I've known for a long time I should have walked down

and it all starts with a knock at his door it's a girl scout trying to sell him cookies he walks up opens the door and just desperately with all of his being wishes he could buy cookies from this girl scout but he can't

because he's broke he doesn't have the money to buy a box so to save face he tells her you know I'm sorry but another girl scout was just here you just missed her and I bought a box of cookies from her and she smiles says thanks walks away he closes the door and upon closing it say never again

never again will I have to turn a girl scout away because I cannot afford the cookies, never again will I be in this place of lack never again
right that's the beginning of a transformation he points to that moment as the day that changed his life
he built a croossroads and changed direction in real time now is this an oversimplification sure right massive transformations are complex no doubt they require a reworking of many things

but they all start with a decision a decision to manufacture that change in your life to take the road you are not currently taking to walk down a new path

these decisions can hurt they force you to become something, you've never been to do things that's no cakewalk
but it's a different kind of hurt it's the short term discomfort pushing against friction it's the building of muscle which is way different than the psychological hurt of knowing that you're out of alignment
knowing deep down there's more in you and that it's fading away with each passing day
that's hurt and we all know in some capacity that life doesn't always create circumstances that move us
life waits for us to move ourselves it waits for the I've had enough moment it waits for us to see the present not as all there is but rather a doorway to the next thing

there are two kinds of crossroads and I'm a believer that a meaningful existence means not waiting for the external to push you but allowing the internal to drive you

it's the classic stands or the stage where do you want to be you can sit and watch clap when you're happy boo when you're mad but ultimately not be in control
