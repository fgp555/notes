```md
there's a latin phrase pronounced amor fati
it's one of the more powerful ideas i've come across
its translation means love of fate
it implies everything that happens is good
or at the very least necessary
and I think we need that reminder from time to time
because funny enough it is one of the first sentiments
to leave us when we're in trouble
when we're down or lost
the idea that everything has its value
and sure we don't always understand it in the moment
or when we're fighting through it

but that circumstance or even tragedy  
in the great play of life has a crucial role
someone recently sent me a beautiful clip
from a Stephen colbert interview
and I want to dive in but there's a caveat I ask that you listen to this a vacuum
for our purposes not going to be the stephen colbert who mocks half country on live TV every night this is the wise Stephen Colbert with a lot of value to add because he can be both
to frame the interview he's sitting across from Anderson Cooper  
and anderson's asking him about something he said a while back

Anderson reads the quote I've learned to love the things I'd most wished had not happened what punishments of god are not gifts Anderson then looks up from the paper looks over at stephen and asks
do you really believe that to which Stephen responds yes it's a gift to exist and with existence comes suffering there's no escaping that
you can't pick and choose what to be grateful for
a truly incredible emotional moment it is the realization of amor fati
