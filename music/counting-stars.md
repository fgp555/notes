Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreamin' about the things that we could be.
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard.
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars.
Yeah, we'll be counting stars.


I see this life like a swingin' vine,
swing my heart across the line.
In my face is flashin' signs,
seek it out and ye shall find.
Old, but I'm not that old,
young, but I'm not that bold.
And I don't think the world is sold,
I'm just doin' what we're told.
I feel something so right, doin' the wrong thing.
I feel something so wrong, doin' the right thing.
I could lie, could lie, could lie...
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive.

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreamin' about the things that we could be.
Baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard.
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars.

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreamin' about the things that we could be.
Baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard.
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be...

we'll be counting stars.
Yeah...

I feel your love, and I feel it burn,
down this river, every turn.
Hope is a 4 letter word,
make that money, watch it burn.
Old, but I'm not that old,
young, but I'm not that bold.
And I don't think the world is sold,
I'm just doin' what we're told.
I feel something so wrong, doin' the right thing.
I could lie, could lie, could lie...
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly.

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreamin' about the things that we could be.
Baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard.
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars.

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreamin' about the things that we could be.
Baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard.
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be...

we'll be counting stars.
Oh, take that money, watch it burn,
sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
Take that money, watch it burn,
sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
Take that money, watch it burn,
sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
Take that money, watch it burn,
sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
Everything that kills me...
makes me feel alive.

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreamin' about the things that we could be.
Baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard.
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars.

Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep.
Dreamin' about the things that we could be.
Baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard.
Said, no more counting dollars, we'll be...

we'll be counting stars.
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
Take that money, watch it burn,
sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
Take that money, watch it burn,
sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
Take that money, watch it burn,
sink in the river, the lessons I've learned.
